# Reign Of Giants
A Borderlands 2 Content Mod Of Epic... Proportions

It's a concept we all know and love: Rare enemy variants, like Loot Midgets and Tubbies. *Reign Of Giants* extends this to __every__ enemy in the game.

Yes, __every__ enemy in the game! In *Reign Of Giants*, Psychos, Loaders, Saturn, Loot Midgets, Varkids, Savage Lee, Dexiduous the Invincible... All have a rare chance of spawning as a gigantic version of their normal self.

Upon encountering a Giant, you will be faced with an enemy notably stronger than the common variant, but will be appropriately rewarded. In addition to more XP, Giants drop a guaranteed item from a specialized loot pool.

*Reign Of Giants* has the additional benefit of compatibility. It will work in co-op, so long as both players are running the mod. It will also work along side other mods, including enemy mods such as Enemy Randomizer and Spawn Multiplier. Currently only Borderlands 2 is supported, however TPS support is planned.

...Was every enemy mentioned enough? Every. Enemy. Plus a few easter eggs. Happy Hunting! (Also, please tag me with screenshots of your best Giants.)
